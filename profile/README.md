# TaleStation's Purpose Statement
TaleStation is committed to giving its players an inclusive, enjoyable roleplaying environment. 

We are not HRP nor MRP, but somewhere in-between. Ideally, we would like to not be identified with such terms. We would like to be known as **the roleplay** server. Simply as. 

Here at TaleStation we want to create an environment where players can become friends with one another, ICly or OOCly, and create interesting and fun narratives. That is to say, many won’t be without strife or conflict. Stories are meant to be interesting, enticing and captivating. If your story follows the format every time, are you having fun? Because that's all that matters! Conflict and strife should be an integral part to stories here at TaleStation. Drama, woes, and murders abound. Every reaction needs a proper re-action to the events. Security is mobilized, the paramedics are dispatched, what a frightful scene! The curator was stabbed to death in the library! A calling card is left on his being, citing a page from a book kept in the library database. Who knows where this drama will go.. Stories don’t need to be inclusive either, but you should also accept new parties to have fun with you! If you’re just having fun with your friends, that's cool! Someone peaking interest? Don’t shy them away, talk to them! Interactions are key to a healthy TaleStation environment. Always ahelp problematic players if they make you uncomfortable. Never take OOC matters into your IC hands. Let the admins deal with it. 

At the end of the day, TaleStation is a server where everyone can have fun. Bad actors will be removed if needed. We hope you enjoy your time here at TaleStation, and hope to see your wonderful stories to come. - The TaleStation administration and coding staff
