# TaleStation's Purpose Statement
TaleStation is committed to giving its players an inclusive, enjoyable roleplaying environment. 

<details>
<summary> Purpose Statement </summary>
We are not HRP nor MRP, but somewhere in-between. Ideally, we would like to not be identified with such terms. We would like to be known as **the roleplay** server. Simply as. 

TaleStation is a non erotic, adult roleplay server.
We want to create a server where everyone and anyone can come and make a story for their characters. 
Classically, we'd be considered a "HRP" server, but we just want to be known as a true "RP" server. Interactions is key!

The environment here at TaleStation should be friendly to approach OOCly. If you have any issues, never be afraid to ahelp or ask staff. We'll try our best to answer questions you may have. Secondly, we want our players to be **as inclusive** as possible. Dramas, tragedies, and comedies abound. Try to include new people to your groups! Who knows, you may just make a new friend.

TaleStation aims to create an atmosphere rich with drama, tragedies, comedies and more. Each story created by every player is unique in its own right; you don't need to be a writer either! Medbay was bombed! The CMO is missing- and there's a chef in the middle of chemistry.. what could this mean?! Each story doesn't need to be thoroughly planned out - it can be on a whim, its perfectly OKAY! Stories can be a shift long or span across multiple shifts, the choice is yours!

Together, as players and staff, we aim to make TaleStation an enjoyable experience for those who aren't so RP heavy and those who enjoy RP.
